Problem 13. C# and .NET Differences

C# is a language and .NET is an application framework. The .NET libraries can run on the Common Language Runtime (CLR) and thus any language which can

 run on the CLR can also use the .NET libraries. C# is a strong Object Oriented programming language that is mostly built on the .NET framework. C# is 
 
 designed for Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), which consists of the executable code and runtime environment that allows use of various high-level 
 
 languages to be used on different computer platforms and architectures.
