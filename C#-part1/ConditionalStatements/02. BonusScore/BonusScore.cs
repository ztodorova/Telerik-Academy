/*Write a program that applies bonus score to given score in the range [1…9] by the following rules:
If the score is between 1 and 3, the program multiplies it by 10.
If the score is between 4 and 6, the program multiplies it by 100.
If the score is between 7 and 9, the program multiplies it by 1000.
If the score is 0 or more than 9, the program prints “invalid score”. */
